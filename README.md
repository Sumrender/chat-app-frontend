Set up centralised Notification component later
Create group route not working, json stringify error

when using search side drawer to move to chat
myChat is not getting updated to show that, the user is selected

when will fetchAgain state in chatpage be used?
used in groupChat modal I think, so that it gets
updated for the added or removed users

when I updated group name, it did not get updated in the myChats sidebar

sendMessage function in SingleChat.jsx
there I have turned setNewMessage("") before using the
value of newMessage in the sendMessage function, but it is
still working properly? why so
Ans => event loop shenanigans
